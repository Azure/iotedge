MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS 
MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY 
These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft 
·         updates, 
·         supplements, 
·          Internet-based services, and 
·          support services 
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply. 
BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE. 
IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE PERPETUAL RIGHTS BELOW. 
1.      INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. 
a.      Installation and Use.  You may install and use any number of copies of the software to design, develop and test your programs. 
b.      Third Party Programs.  The software may include third party programs that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party program are included for your information only. 
2.      DATA.  The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to improve our products and services. You can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and the privacy statement at  http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=528096 . Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.

·          indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of your programs. 
iii.     Distribution Restrictions.  You may not 
·          alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable Code; 
·          use Microsoft’s trademarks in your programs’ names or in a way that suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft; 
·          include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs; or 
·          modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that 
·          the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or 
·          others have the right to modify it. 
4.      SCOPE OF LICENSE.  The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not 
·          work around any technical limitations in the software;

7.      EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see  www.microsoft.com/exporting. 
8.      SUPPORT SERVICES.  Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it. 
9.      ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services. 
10.     APPLICABLE LAW. 
a.      United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort. 
b.      Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply. 
11.    LEGAL EFFECT.  This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so. 
12.    DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. 
FOR AUSTRALIA – YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS. 
13.    LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. 
This limitation applies to 
·          anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and 
·          claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages. 
Please note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French. 
Remarque : Ce logiciel étant distribué au Québec, Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français. 
EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE.  Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril. Microsoft n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier de droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues. 
LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES DOMMAGES.  Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bénéfices. 
Cette limitationconcerne: 
·          tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes tiers ; et 
·          les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur. 
Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard. 
EFFET JURIDIQUE.  Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.

	notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	as modifying the License.
	
	You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

	whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY 
These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft
·         updates,
·         supplements,
·         Internet-based services, and
·         support services
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.
BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.
IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE PERPETUAL RIGHTS BELOW.
1.    INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. 
a.    Installation and Use. You may install and use any number of copies of the software to design, develop and test your programs.  You may modify, copy, distribute or deploy any .js files contained in the software as part of your programs.
b.    Third Party Programs. The software may include third party programs that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party program are included for your information only.
2.    ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.
a.    DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.  In addition to the .js files described above, the software is comprised of Distributable Code. “Distributable Code” is code that you are permitted to distribute in programs you develop if you comply with the terms below.
i.      Right to Use and Distribute. 
·         You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.
·         Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those programs.
ii.    Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must
·         use the Distributable Code in your programs and not as a standalone distribution;
·         require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this agreement;
·         display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and
·         indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of your programs.
iii.   Distribution Restrictions. You may not
·         alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable Code;
·         use Microsoft’s trademarks in your programs’ names or in a way that suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;
·         include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs; or
·         modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that
·         the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or
·         others have the right to modify it.
3.    SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
·         work around any technical limitations in the software;
·         reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;
·         publish the software for others to copy;
·         rent, lease or lend the software; or
·         transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.
4.    BACKUP COPY. You may make one backup copy of the software. You may use it only to reinstall the software.
5.    DOCUMENTATION. Any person that has valid access to your computer or internal network may copy and use the documentation for your internal, reference purposes.
6.    EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.
7.    SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.
8.    ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.
9.    APPLICABLE LAW.
a.    United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
b.    Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.
10.  LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.
11.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
FOR AUSTRALIA – YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS.
12.  LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to
·         anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
·         claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
Please note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.
Remarque : Ce logiciel étant distribué au Québec, Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.
EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril. Microsoft n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier de droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues.
LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bénéfices.
Cette limitation concerne :
·         tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes tiers ; et
·         les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.
Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.
EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.

	and conversions to other media types.
	
	"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
	Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
	(an example is provided in the Appendix below).
	
	"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	
	"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
	the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

	the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
	means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
	to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
	communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

	worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

	where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	meet the following conditions:
	
	(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	stating that You changed the files; and
	
	(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	the Derivative Works; and
	
	(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	as modifying the License.
	
	You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	the conditions stated in this License.
	
	5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
	
	END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
	not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
	and conversions to other media types.
	
	"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
	Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
	copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
	(an example is provided in the Appendix below).
	
	"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
	form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
	editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
	represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
	of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
	separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
	the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
	
	"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
	the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

	to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
	communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
	and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
	Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

	"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
	on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
	subsequently incorporated within the Work.
	
	2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
	
	3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	as of the date such litigation is filed.
	
	4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	meet the following conditions:
	
	(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
	
	(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	stating that You changed the files; and
	
	(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	the Derivative Works; and
	
	(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	as modifying the License.
	
	You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	the conditions stated in this License.
	
	5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
	
	6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
	
	7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
	
	8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
	
	9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------
PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.
The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.
"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).

Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

For legal entities, "You" or "Your" includes any entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, You, where "control" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,
whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of such entity.
2. Permitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on the date You accept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to the extent of Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and copyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following:
2.1 Unmodified Code. You may use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy verbatim, unmodified copies of the Original Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance:
(a) You must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear in the Original Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to this License; and (b) You must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of Covered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally Deploy, and You may not offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this License or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section 6.
2.2 Modified Code. You may modify Covered Code and use, reproduce, display, perform, internally distribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy Your Modifications and Covered Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided that in each instance You also meet all of these conditions:
(a) You must satisfy all the conditions of Section 2.1 with respect to the Source Code of the Covered Code;
(b) You must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code of all Your Modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files and the date of any change; and
(c) If You Externally Deploy Your Modifications, You must make Source Code of all Your Externally Deployed Modifications either available to those to whom You have Externally Deployed Your Modifications, or publicly available. Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms set forth in
this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3 below, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12) months from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is longer. You should preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Externally Deployed Modifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site).
2.3 Distribution of Executable Versions. In addition, if You Externally Deploy Covered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code, executable form only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available under the
terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such Source Code.
2.4 Third Party Rights. You expressly acknowledge and agree that although Apple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any Contributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor disclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to distribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Covered Code.
3. Your Grants. In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity receiving or distributing Covered Code under this License a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent Rights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or controlled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense, distribute and Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent as Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.
4. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In each such instance, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion thereof.
5. Limitations on Patent License. Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no other patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein. Modifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from Apple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.
6. Additional Terms. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein ("Additional Terms") to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf and as Your sole
responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any Contributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional Terms are offered by You alone, and  You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of any such Additional Terms.
7. Versions of the License. Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any subsequent version of this License published by Apple. No one other than Apple has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.
8. NO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT. The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part pre-release, untested, or not fully tested works. The Covered Code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies. You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Covered Code, or any portion thereof, is at Your sole and entire risk. THE COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY, UPGRADES OR SUPPORT OF ANY KIND AND APPLE AND APPLE'S LICENSOR(S) (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS "APPLE" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 8 AND 9) AND ALL CONTRIBUTORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE COVERED CODE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE COVERED CODE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE COVERED CODE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE COVERED CODE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE, AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY.
You acknowledge that the Covered Code is not intended for use in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the Covered Code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.
9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE OR ANY CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE COVERED CODE, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, WHETHER UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCTS LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF APPLE OR SUCH CONTRIBUTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY REMEDY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple's total liability to You for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law) under this
License exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).
10. Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names "Apple", "Apple Computer", "Mac", "Mac OS", "QuickTime", "QuickTime  Streaming Server" or any other trademarks, service marks, logos or trade names belonging to Apple (collectively "Apple Marks") or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name belonging to any Contributor. You agree not to use any Apple Marks in or as part of the name of products derived from the Original Code or to endorse or promote products derived from the Original Code other than as expressly permitted by and in strict compliance at all times with Apple's third party trademark usage guidelines which are posted at http://www.apple.com/legal/guidelinesfor3rdparties.html.
11. Ownership. Subject to the licenses granted under this License, each Contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any Modifications made by such Contributor. Apple retains all rights, title and interest in and to the Original Code and any Modifications made by or on behalf of Apple ("Apple Modifications"), and such Apple Modifications will not be automatically subject to this License. Apple may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such Apple Modifications under this License, or on different terms from those contained in this License or may choose not to license them at all.
12. Termination.
12.1 Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate:
(a) automatically without notice from Apple if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this License and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach; (b) immediately in the event of the circumstances described in Section 13.5(b); or (c) automatically without notice from Apple if You, at any time during
the term of this License, commence an action for patent infringement against Apple; provided that Apple did not first commence an action for patent infringement against You in that instance.
12.2 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, You agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the Covered Code. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.2 and 13. No party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this License in accordance with its terms, and termination of this License will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party.
13. Miscellaneous.
13.1 Government End Users. The Covered Code is a "commercial item" as defined in FAR 2.101. Government software and technical data rights in the Covered Code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this License. This customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with FAR 12.211 (Technical Data) and 12.212 (Computer Software) and, for Department of Defense purchases, DFAR 252.227-7015 (Technical Data -- Commercial Items) and 227.7202-3 (Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Computer Software Documentation). Accordingly, all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.
13.2 Relationship of Parties. This License will not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture or any other form of legal association between or among You, Apple or any Contributor, and You will not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by implication, appearance or otherwise.
13.3 Independent Development. Nothing in this License will impair Apple's right to acquire, license, develop, have others develop for it, market and/or distribute technology or products that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Modifications, Larger Works, technology or products that You may
develop, produce, market or distribute.
13.4 Waiver; Construction. Failure by Apple or any Contributor to enforce any provision of this License will not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter will not apply to this License.
13.5 Severability. (a) If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this License, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the License will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the economic benefits and intent of the parties, and the remainder of this License will continue in full force and effect. (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if applicable law prohibits or restricts You from fully and/or specifically complying with Sections 2 and/or 3 or prevents the enforceability of either of those Sections, this License will immediately terminate and You must immediately discontinue any use of
the Covered Code and destroy all copies of it that are in your possession or control.
13.6 Dispute Resolution. Any litigation or other dispute resolution between You and Apple relating to this License shall take place in the Northern District of California, and You and Apple hereby consent to the personal jurisdiction of, and venue in, the state and federal courts within that District with respect to this License. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
13.7 Entire Agreement; Governing Law. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, except that body of California law concerning conflicts of law.
Where You are located in the province of Quebec, Canada, the following clause applies: The parties hereby confirm that they have requested that this License and all related documents be drafted in English. Les parties ont exige que le present contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rediges en anglais.
