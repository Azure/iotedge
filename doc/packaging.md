# Packaging

## What's New

The version 1.2 of IoT Edge introduces significant changes to the underlying daemon which has been refactored and renamed (`iotedged` -> `aziot-edged`). Non-Edge specific functionality was separated into a stand-alone package, `aziot-identity-service`, on which the IoT Edge daemon now depends. The term 'service' in the name is in the context of it being a Systemd service. The `aziot-identity-service` package replaces the `libiothsm-std` package previously used. The two new packages together maintain the same design principles and goals as the original IoT Edge security daemon.

In anticipation of these large-scale changes we've made the current `iotedge` Linux package (v1.1) into a long-term servicing (LTS) release. The v1.2 of IoT Edge is now composed of two packages:

- `aziot-edge`: This package contains what remained of the security daemon (`aziot-edged`). It acts as a module runtime needed to deploy and manage containerized Edge modules. It is simply referred to as the IoT Edge daemon or the IoT Edge module runtime (MR). It has a dependency on the `aziot-identity-service` package, and on the Moby runtime package.

- `aziot-identity-service`: This package installs daemon's that are responsible for provisioning the device, managing module identities, and managing cryptographic keys and certificates. 
## Comparing Packages

A comparison of the contents of each package is below. For more in-depth discussion of the `aziot-identity-service` package, refer to its documentation on [Packaging](https://azure.github.io/iot-identity-service/packaging.html).

The `iotedge` CLI tool is used to interact with the new `aziot-edged` service as well as its dependent `aziot-*` services from the `aziot-identity-service` package. Restarting or viewing logs of the combined services is done using the new `iotedge system` sub-commands. Optionally, the `systemctl` and `journalctl` tools may still be used.

The `aziotctl` CLI tool is similar to `iotedge`, but is limited in scope to the set of `aziot-*` services deployed as part of the package. It supports a subset of the commands found in the `iotedge` CLI. When IoT Edge is installed, the `iotedge` CLI should be used.

Configuration of all `aziot-*` services is done through a "super-config" file. The contents of the configuration file are applied to the individual services via the new `iotedge config apply` command. A template is installed at `/etc/aziot/config.toml.edge.template`. It includes IoT Edge-specific configuration values. Note that the expected syntax is now in TOML format. 

By default the `iotedge` CLI commands assume the "super-config" is available at `/etc/aziot/config.toml`. A common practice is to use a copy of the template as the initial `/etc/aziot/config.toml`.

The `aziotctl config apply` command takes a configuration file in TOML format as input and generates an individual `config.toml` file for each service.

The provided `config.toml.template` is a template for configuration values that applies to the services contained in this package. It may also be used as a starting point for the `config.toml` from which configuration is applied to the individual services.

## Installation

For full documentation refer to the official documentation to [Install or uninstall Azure IoT Edge for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge?view=iotedge-2020-11). What follows is a brief summary with accompanying notes. It assumes you have already installed a compatible container engine.

```sh
apt install aziot-edge

sudo cp /etc/aziot/config.toml.edge.template /etc/aziot/config.toml

sudo nano -w /etc/aziot/config.toml

iotedge config apply
```

After installing the `aziot-edge` package, copy the `/etc/aziot/config.toml.edge.template` to `/etc/aziot/config.toml` and edit the file to provide provisioning information.  Then run `iotedge config apply` to apply the configuration to the services. This performs initialization for both the IS+KS+CS+TPMS components installed by the `aziot-identity-service` package and the MR component installed by the `aziot-edge` package.

## Updating from `iotedge` to `aziot-edge`

```sh
apt install aziot-edge

sudo iotedge config import
```

The `iotedge config import` can be used to generate the `/etc/aziot/config.toml` based on the old `/etc/iotedge/config.yaml` left behind after uninstalling versions 1.1 or earlier of IoT Edge. This assumes the `--purge` option is **not** used to remove IoT Edge version 1.1. or earlier.

We do not support simultaneously running the services from both the old and new packages. They would step over each other trying to provision the device and manage Docker modules. We enforce mutual exclusivity between the packages by having them conflict with each other. This causes the distribution's package manager (e.g `apt` or `apt-get`) to not allow them both to be installed at the same time. This does not work if `dpkg` is used directly. Instead, the existing `iotedge` and `libiothsm-std` packages must be removed before installing the `aziot-edge` package (or even the `aziot-identity-service` package).

### Importing Configuration

This command helps ease the transition from v1.1 to v1.2.

```sh
iotedge config import
```

Notes on behavior:

- The device provisioning method is parsed from `/etc/iotedge/config.yaml` and translated into the provisioning information in `/etc/aziot/config.toml`.

- User-provided certificates like device ID, device CA and trust bundle, and their corresponding private key files, will be added as preloaded keys and certs in `config.toml`. The files themselves will not be moved because they are managed by the user rather than belonging in our services' directories.

    > **Note** This assumes that Microsoft's implementation of `libiothsm-std` is being used where the certs and keys are stored as files on disk. This is a reasonable assumption since we are not aware of any external Edge customers that have written their own `libiothsm-std` implementations which store keys and certs differently.

- The imported device CA will now be referred to as the "Edge CA".

- The master encryption key that IoT Edge internally creates and uses (e.g. by the workload API's encrypt/decrypt methods) will be imported into the new services.

- The workload CA cert is no longer used with `aziot-edged` and will not be imported.

- Module identity certs and module server certs will not be imported. Modules will get new certs signed directly by the Edge CA (formerly called the device CA) when they request them.

- The `import` command does not detect and modify the access rules to the TPM. The `/etc/udev/rules.d/tpmaccess.rules` would still need to be manually updated to allow the `aziottpm` access to `tpm0` instead of `iotedge`.

### Encrypting / Decrypting Secrets via Workload API

Secrets encrypted using the [workload API](../edgelet/workload/docs/WorkloadAPI.md) in IoT Edge v1.2 are saved in a new format.

The workload API in v1.2 supports _reading_ secrets saved in the prior format using the imported master encryption key. However, it does not support _writing_ encrypted secrets in the old format. Once a secret is re-encrypted by a module, it is saved in the new format.

**Warning:** Secrets encrypted in v1.2 are unreadable by the same module in v1.1. If you are persisting encrypted data to a host mounted folder / volume, then be sure to create a backup copy of the data _before_ upgrading to retain the ability to easily downgrade.

## Downgrading

You can downgrade from v1.2 to the v1.1 by uninstalling the `aziot-edge` and `aziot-identity-service` packages, then reinstalling the `iotedge` package. Unless the `iotedge` package was previously purged (i.e. using apt or apt-get's `--purge` option) then the old configuration will still be available and used by a downgraded IoT Edge.

```sh
sudo apt remove aziot-edge aziot-identity-service

sudo apt install iotedge
```

   > **Note**
   >
   > Per the previous discussion on the workload API, if a module cannot recover when it fails to decrypt a secret then you may need to remove and re-add the module as part of a new deployment to put it into a clean state.
