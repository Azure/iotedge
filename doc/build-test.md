IoT Edge Build and Test Infrastructure
============================================

Build
-----

We use Azure DevOps to build and release.

More information about Azure DevOps is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/overview).

Our builds fall into these categories:

| Type                                      | Goal                                                                                                          | Trigger                                        | Target                      |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Checkin                                   | Ensures that the master branch builds clean and passes basic tests.                                           | When commits are pushed to a Pull Request (PR) | Linux - x64                 |
| Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)      | Scans and analyzes the code to detect security issues.                                                        | When commits are pushed to a PR                | Windows - x64               |
| Continuous Integration (CI)               | Runs end-to-end tests, builds Docker images & publishes to ACR, builds iotedgectl pypi archive.               | After a PR is merged to master                 | Linux - x64, Windows - x64  |
| Continuous Deployment (CD)                | Consumes artifacts from CI, deploys IoT Edge to a Linux VM and a Raspberry Pi and tests basic functionality.  | After a successful CI build                    | Linux - x64                 |
| Images                                    | Builds Docker images & publishes to ACR.                                                                      | Manual                                         | Linux - x64, Windows - x64  |
| Service Deployment Verification           | Runs smoke tests. Used to validate IoT Edge scenarios before the service deploys updates.                     | Manual                                         | Linux - x64                 |
| Release Build                             | Under the Release/ folder. Builds IoT Edge core runtime (C#) and iotedgectl tool (Python).                    | Manual                                         | Linux - x64, Windows - x64  |
| Release Publish                           | Under the Release/ folder. Builds Docker images from signed IoT Edge runtime binaries.                        | Manual                                         | Linux - x64, Windows - x64  |


Test
----

Our C# tests use [xUnit](https://xunit.github.io/docs/getting-started-dotnet-core). Each test is tagged with one of the following attributes:

| Attribute   | Goal                                                                                            | Notes                                                                                 | Runs in build(s)  |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Unit        | Fast, reliable, repeatable tests against low-level components of the codebase.                  | Should not depend on external resources (e.g., network, disk) or configuration.       | Checkin           |
| Integration | Tests that verify interaction with dependencies _in isolation_ and core end-to-end scenarios.    | Require external configuration.                                                       | CI                |
| Stress      | Specialized end-to-end tests for scenarios under heavy load.                                    |                                                                                       | N/A               |

Besides these tests, E2E scenario testing is implemented in IotEdgeQuickstart and LeafDevice project in smoke folder.  These tests will be run in Linux, Raspberry Pi and Windows to ensure all core IoT Edge features function correctly.
