# IoT Edge Metrics

The IoT Edge Hub and Edge Agent module expose a number of metrics in the Prometheus exposition format that provide insights into its operational state.

## How to enable

As of release 1.0.9, metrics are exposed as an experimental feature available at http port **9600** of the Edge Hub and Edge Agent module. To enable, the following environment variables should be set for each module (make note of the double underscores):

| Environment Variable Name                | value  |
|------------------------------------------|--------|
| `ExperimentalFeatures__Enabled`          | `true` |
| `ExperimentalFeatures__EnableMetrics`    | `true` |

### Windows Note (1.0.9 only)
Metrics on Windows are not fully supported the 1.0.9 experimental release. Host metrics (cpu, memory and disk usage) will all show as 0. Moby metrics are supported. In addition, edgeHub must be started as a container administrator to expose metrics. 

This is no longer required in the 1.0.10 release

Add the following to EdgeHub createOptions (on Windows only):
```JSON
createOptions: {
  "User": "ContainerAdministrator",
  "ExposedPorts": {}
}
```

## Metrics

Note: All metrics contain the following tags

Tag | Description
---|---
iothub | The hub the device is talking to
edge_device | The device id of the current device
instance_number | A Guid representing the current runtime. On restart, all metrics will be reset. This Guid makes it easier to reconcile restarts.

### Collecting

Metrics will be available for collection at `http://edgeHub:9600/metrics` on the IoT Edge module network or `http://localhost:9600/metrics` if port mapped to the host at the default port number. 

For mapping to host, the port will need to be exposed from Edge Hub's `createOptions`:

```
{
  "ExposedPorts": {
    "9600/tcp": {},
  }
<Other options, if any>
}
```
