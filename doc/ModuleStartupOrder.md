# How to configure module startup order

By default, IoT Edge does not impose an ordering in the sequence in which modules are started, updated or stopped. Edge Agent by default is the first module that gets started and based on the edge deployment specification, it figures out which modules need to be started, updated or stopped and executes those operations in a non-deterministic order.

The processing order of modules can be controlled by specifying the value of a module-specific property called `startupOrder` in the IoT Edge deployment. Modules that have been assigned a lower integer value as the startup order will be processed before modules that have been assigned a higher value.

## __Use case__

Customers who have an array of modules of which some are 'critical' or 'foundation' modules that are required by other modules in the ecosystem might want these modules to be started before other modules. This is so as to achieve a better end user experience where other modules don't have to wait for these 'critical' or 'foundation' modules to be started, so as to initialize themselves.

As an example, some customers want the Edge Hub module to be started before any other non-system modules in the ecosystem are started. This is so that other modules don't spend unnecessary cycles waiting for Edge Hub to come up before they can start sending messages to other modules or upstream to IoT Hub.

**That being said, module owners should design their modules to withstand any failures of these 'critical' or 'foundation' modules, that they are dependent upon, as they could go down at any arbitrary time and an arbitrary number of times.**

## __Configuration__

Customers can optionally specify a `startupOrder` value for each module in their IoT Edge deployment. This can be used to achieve module boot ordering. Modules with startup order of '1' are created and processed before those with a value greater than '1'. The maximum value of this property will be 4294967295. Only after an attempt has been made to start those with a lower value will those with a higher value be created and started. Startup order does not imply that a given module that starts before another will *complete* its startup before the other. Also, modules where the desired state is NOT configured to be 'Running' are skipped.

The value of `startupOrder` must be positive and zero-based (i.e. a value of '0' means start this module first). Modules that possess the same startupOrder will be created at the same time and will have no deterministic startup order imposed amongst themselves. 

**It must be noted that the Edge Agent module does not support the `startupOrder` property. It always starts first.**

Modules without a specified `startupOrder` value are started in a non-deterministic order. They are assigned the maximum startupOrder of 4294967295 indicating that they should be created and started after all other modules with specified values.

**Please note that Kubernetes mode of IoT Edge does not support module startup ordering.**

## __Example__

### __How to set startup order of Edge modules__

Here's an example of how to set the startupOrder of IoT Edge modules through Az CLI:

Create a deployment manifest `deployment.json` JSON file that has your IoT Edge deployment specification. Please refer to [Learn how to deploy modules and establish routes in IoT Edge][1] for more information about the IoT Edge deployment manifest.

The following sample deployment manifest illustrates how startupOrder values of modules can be set:

```JSON

  "modulesContent": {
    "$edgeAgent": {
      "properties.desired": {
        "schemaVersion": "1.1",
        "runtime": {
          "type": "docker",
          "settings": {

              }

          }
        },
        "systemModules": {
          "edgeAgent": {

            "settings": {
              "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-agent:1.0",
              "createOptions": ""
            }
          },
          "edgeHub": {

            "settings": {
              "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-hub:1.0",
              "createOptions": ""
            },
            "startupOrder": 0
          }
        },
        "modules": {
          "SimulatedTemperatureSensor": {
            "version": "1.0",
            "type": "docker",
            "status": "running",
            "restartPolicy": "always",
            "settings": {
              "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotedge-simulated-temperature-sensor:1.0",
              "createOptions": "{}"
            },
            "startupOrder": 1
          },
          "filtermodule": {
            "version": "1.0",
            "type": "docker",
            "status": "running",
            "restartPolicy": "always",
            "settings": {
              "image": "myacr.azurecr.io/filtermodule:latest",
              "createOptions": "{}"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "$edgeHub": {
      "properties.desired": {
        "schemaVersion": "1.0",
        "routes": {
          "sensorToFilter": "FROM /messages/modules/SimulatedTemperatureSensor/outputs/temperatureOutput INTO BrokeredEndpoint(\"/modules/filtermodule/inputs/input1\")",
          "filterToIoTHub": "FROM /messages/modules/filtermodule/outputs/output1 INTO $upstream"
        },
        "storeAndForwardConfiguration": {
          "timeToLiveSecs": 10
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the sample deployment manifest shown above:

* The `$edgeAgent` schemaVersion has been set to 1.1 (or later).
* The `edgeAgent` module always starts first.  It does not support the `startupOrder` property.
* The `edgeHub` module has been assigned a `startupOrder` value of 0.
* The `SimulatedTemperatureSensor` module has been assigned a `startupOrder` value of 1.
* The `filtermodule` module has not been assigned any `startupOrder` value which means that it will by default assume the value of 4294967295. It will be created and started after all others.

When this deployment manifest is deployed to a device that does not have any modules running, `$edgeHub` is the first module that will be started followed by the `SimulatedTemperatureSensor` module and then the `filtermodule`.
