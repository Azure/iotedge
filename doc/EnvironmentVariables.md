### <a id="cloudauthnote">Cloud AuthenticationMode not supported in production</a>

Cloud authentication is not supported in production because of several known limitations:
- Does not work for clients with x509 certitificate authentication (thumbprint or CA)
- Does not work in offline mode
- When a device sends telemetry and disconnects before EdgeHub, there is no way for EdgeHub to drain those messages to IoT Hub
- Token refresh or validation requires dropping connection to the device and may cause stability issues.
