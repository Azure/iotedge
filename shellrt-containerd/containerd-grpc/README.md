# containerd-grpc

Bindings to [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/)'s gRPC API, backed by [`tonic`](https://docs.rs/tonic).

## API notes:

There are several places in the containerd gRPC API where a protobuf `Any` type is used. Determining the structure of this Any type will typically require spelunking through the containerd codebase to determine what kind of data is being marshalled/unmarhalled into it.

To aid in this unfortunate quest, here's some information that might help:

To make add some structure to the `Any` type, containerd uses a library called [`typeurl`](https://github.com/containerd/typeurl). In a nutshell, it transforms the raw protobuf `Any` type into a tagged union of `all protobuf builtin types` + `any "registered" types`, where "registered" types are specified at runtime by the client and server. These "registered" types are then marshalled as JSON strings, stuffed into the `Any` bytes array, and reconstructed on the other end.

Currently, the list of types containerd registers with `typeurl` can be found in [containerd/runtime/typeurl.go](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/runtime/typeurl.go).

Notably, all of these types are OCI-Runtime spec JSON objects, which should be easy to encode as Serde-annotated Rust structures.

## `proto/` Directory Structure

containerd uses a go-specific protobuf build system called [`protobuild`](https://github.com/stevvooe/protobuild) which has certain features which `prost` doesn't, namely, the ability to specify directory/dependency path remapping. As such, the directory structure of the `proto/` directory must match the import paths specified in the containerd `.proto` files _exactly_, which results in the [seemingly unnecessary] nested folder structure. 

## Updating `.proto` definitions

All `.proto` files are copied over verbatim from their respective repos. They are not patched or modified in any way. 

As such, updating the `.proto` files should be as simple as adding the new/updated `.proto` files to the appropriate subdirectory, updating the build script, and bumping the crate version number.

That said, take heed of the warnings in `build.rs`! protobufs are finicky bits of code, and something as benign as compilation order can have effects on the generated code. Be careful when adding new protobufs, and make sure that all the expected types are generated!
