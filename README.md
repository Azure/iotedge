# IoT Edge

[![Build status](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_apis/build/status/Custom/Azure/IoT/Edge/Core/Azure-IoT-Edge-Core%20CI)](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_build/latest?definitionId=4977)

Welcome to the home of IoT Edge.

IoT Edge moves cloud analytics and custom business logic to devices so that your organization can focus on business insights instead of data management.
Enable your solution to truly scale by configuring your IoT software, deploying it to devices via standard containers, and monitoring it all from the cloud.
This repository consists of three main projects: the [Edge Agent](edge-agent), the [Edge Hub](edge-hub), and the [IoT Edge Security Daemon](edgelet).

## Documentation
Documentation for the Azure IoT Edge product can be found at https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge.
