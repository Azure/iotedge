///   keys.
/// - Keys SHOULD be named using a reverse domain notation - e.g.
///   com.example.myKey.
/// - The prefix org.opencontainers is reserved for keys defined in Open
///   Container Initiative (OCI) specifications and MUST NOT be used by other
///   specifications and extensions.
/// - Keys using the org.opencontainers.image namespace are reserved for use in
///   the OCI Image Specification and MUST NOT be used by other specifications
///   and extensions, including other OCI specifications.
/// - If there are no annotations then this property MUST either be absent or be
///   an empty map.
/// - Consumers MUST NOT generate an error if they encounter an unknown
///   annotation key.
