# Set up EdgeAgent to run as a non-root user at runtime, if allowed.
# 
# If this script is started as root:
#  1. It reads the EDGEAGENTUSER_ID environment variable, default UID=1000.
#  2. If the User ID does not exist as a user, create it.
#  3. If "StorageFolder" env variable exists, use as basepath, else use /tmp
#     Do same for backuppath
#  4. If basepath/edgeAgent exists, make sure all files are owned by EDGEAGENTUSER_ID
#     Do same for backuppath/edgeAgent_backup
#  5. Make sure file specified by IOTEDGE_MANAGEMENTURI is owned by EDGEAGENTUSER_ID
#  6. Make sure /app/backup.json is writeable.
#  7. Set user id as EDGEAGENTUSER_ID.
# then start Edge Agent.
#
# This preserves backwards compatibility with earlier versions of edgeAgent and
# allows some flexibility in the assignment of the edgeagent user id. The default 
# is UID 1000.
#
# A user is created because at this time DotNet Core 2.x and 3.x can only install
# trust bundles into system stores or user stores.  We choose a user store in
# the code, so a writeable user directory is required.
