    # In order to benefit from HA, at a minimum the data location for iotedged
    # should be backed by a persistent volume. Please setup a persistent volume
    # and define a persistent volume claim and provide its reference below. If
    # this is not provided then the iotedged pod will default to using an
    # "emptyDir" volume which doesn't work for HA because its lifetime is linked
    # to the pod's lifetime.

  # Configures the certificates required to operate the IoT Edge
  # runtime as a gateway which enables external leaf devices to securely
  # communicate with the Edge Hub. If not specified, the required certificates
  # are auto generated for quick start scenarios which are not intended for
  # production environments.
  #
  # Please create a secret containing 3 items, the Device CA cert, the Device CA private key, and
  # the root CA. Then give the chart the secret name and the item names. For example, if a secret 
  # is created like this:
  # `kubectl create secret generic -n device-namespace edge-certs --from-file=certs/iot-edge-device-ca-MyEdgeDeviceCA-full-chain.cert.pem --from-file=private/iot-edge-device-ca-MyEdgeDeviceCA.key.pem --from-file=certs/azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem`
  # The YAML would look like:
  # certificates:
  #   secret: "edge-certs"
  #   device_ca_cert: "iot-edge-device-ca-MyEdgeDeviceCA-full-chain.cert.pem"
  #   device_ca_pk: "iot-edge-device-ca-MyEdgeDeviceCA.key.pem"
  #   trusted_ca_certs: "azure-iot-test-only.root.ca.cert.pem"
  #
  # certificates:
  #   secret: "<Name of secret>"
  #   device_ca_cert: "<ADD SECRET ITEM NAME FOR DEVICE CA CERTIFICATE HERE>"
  #   device_ca_pk: "<ADD SECRET ITEM NAME FOR CA PRIVATE KEY HERE>"
  #   trusted_ca_certs: "<ADD SECRET ITEM NAME FOR CA CERTIFICATES HERE>"
