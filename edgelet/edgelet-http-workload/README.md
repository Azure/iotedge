# Workload APIs

The workload APIs are available on the workload socket, which by default is `/run/iotedge/workload.sock`. They deal with certificates and encryption.

The workload APIs are divided into the following groups:
- [List Modules](doc/list_modules.md)
- [Module Certificates](doc/module_certificates.md)
- [Encryption](doc/encryption.md)
- [Trust Bundles](doc/trust_bundles.md)
