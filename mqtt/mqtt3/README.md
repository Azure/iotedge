An MQTT v3.1.1 Client implementation in Rust


# Features

- Supports the entire protocol, including all three QoS levels and wills.
- Transparently handles keep-alive pings.
- Transparently reconnects when connection is broken or protocol errors, with back-off.
- Handles subscription and ongoing QoS 1 and QoS 2 publish workflows across reconnections. You don't need to resubscribe or republish messages when the connection is re-established.
- Agnostic to the underlying transport, so it can run over TCP, TLS, WebSockets, etc.
- Standard futures 0.3 and tokio 0.2 interface. The client is just a `futures_core::Stream` of publications received from the server. The underlying transport just needs to implement `tokio::io::AsyncRead` and `tokio::io::AsyncWrite`.
