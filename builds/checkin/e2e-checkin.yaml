  # A 'minimal' pipeline only runs one end-to-end test (TempSensor). This is useful for platforms or

  # with the 'docker-ce' package vs. Ubuntu 18.04 with the 'iotedge-moby' package vs. the same
  # variations in Ubuntu 20.04. In these instances the platforms/environments are so similar that we
  # don't reasonably expect to encounter differences--if we do, it would likely manifest during
  # installation, or in running a very basic test. We don't need to repeat the entire test suite.
  # The 'minimal' variable defaults to 'false'; we override it in specific jobs as needed.
