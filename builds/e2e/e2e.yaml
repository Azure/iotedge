  # A 'minimal' pipeline only runs one end-to-end test (TempSensor). This is useful for platforms or
  # environments that are very similar to other platforms/environments in our matrix, e.g. Windows
  # Server 2019 vs. Windows 10 Enterprise, or Ubuntu 18.04 with the 'docker-ce' package vs. Ubuntu
  # 18.04 with the 'iotedge-moby' package vs. the same variations in Ubuntu 20.04. In these
  # instances the platforms/environments are so similar that we don't reasonably expect to encounter
  # differences--if we do, it would likely manifest during installation, or in running a very basic
  # test. We don't need to repeat the entire test suite.
  # The 'minimal' variable defaults to 'false'; we override it in specific jobs as needed.
