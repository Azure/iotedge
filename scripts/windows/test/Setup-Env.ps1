    .SYNOPSIS
        Powershell utility to setup environment for running E2E tests for Windows.

    .DESCRIPTION
        It is used to wrap all related steps to setup the environment for running E2E tests for Windows;
        It detects Windows IoT Core vs Windows Pro/Enterprise/Server and installs/updates/uninstalls iotedge service accordingly.

        To get details about parameters, please run "Get-Help .\Env-Setup.ps1 -Parameter *"

        Please ensure that E2E test folder have below folders/files:
        - artifacts\core-windows: artifact from Image build.
        - artifacts\iotedged-windows: artifact from edgelet build.
        - artifacts\packages: contains packages of Moby docker engine, CLI and IoT Edge security daemon.
          Either artifacts\iotedged-windows or packages folder exists, which is used for IoT Edge security daemon installation.

    .PARAMETER E2ETestFolder
        Path of E2E test folder which contains artifacts and certs folders; Default is current directory.

    .PARAMETER ArtifactImageBuildNumber
        Artifact image build number; it is used to construct path of docker images, pulling from docker registry. E.g. 20190101.1.

    .PARAMETER AttemptUpdate
        Switch controlling if an update of iotedge service should be attempted.

    .EXAMPLE
        .\Setup-Env.ps1
            -E2ETestFolder "C:\Data\e2etests"
            -ArtifactImageBuildNumber "20190101.1"
            -AttemptUpdate

    .NOTES
        This script is to setup the environment for running E2E tests.
        It detects and handles different Windows version differently.
        It triggers reboot on Windows IoT Core.
