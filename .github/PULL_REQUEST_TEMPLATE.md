# Azure IoTEdge PR checklist:

This checklist is used to make sure that common guidelines for a pull request are followed.

### General Guidelines and Best Practices
- [ ] Title of the pull request is clear and informative.
- [ ] Description of the pull request includes a brief summary of the enhancement or bug fix.
- [ ] There are a small number of commits, each of which have an informative message. This means that previously merged commits do not appear in the history of the PR. For more information on cleaning up the commits in your PR, [see this page](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/blob/master/documentation/development-docs/cleaning-up-commits.md).
- [ ] I have read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/azure/iotedge#contributing).
### Testing Guidelines
- [ ] Description of the pull request includes a brief summary of tests added/modified and the local testing done.  
- [ ] Pull request includes test coverage for the included changes.

### Draft PRs
- Open the PR in `Draft` mode if it is:
	- Work in progress or not intended to be merged.
	- Encountering multiple pipeline failures and working on fixes.
