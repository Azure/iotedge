Azure IoT Edge Runtime Control
==============================

Deprecation Notice
------------------
The azure-iot-edge-runtime-ctl (iotedgectl) tool has now been deprecated!
The Azure IoT Edge runtime (Edge Agent and Edge Hub)
will continue to work when launched using this utility. However since the official release of the
Edge security daemon, using this utility to launch the IoT Edge runtime is discouraged.
To learn more about the officially supported Azure IoT Edge please visit:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/>`__.

Introduction
------------

The Azure IoT Edge Runtime Control utility assists a user in managing
and controlling the IoT Edge runtime.

Specifically, it can help: \* Initial setup or bootstrap \* Certificate
provisioning \* Starting/Stopping and other IoT Edge runtime control
options.

Prerequisites
-------------

-  Python 2.7+
-  Python setuptools (for pip installation)
-  Docker

Installation
------------

Python
~~~~~~

Installation requires python and setuptools. Download `python
here <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__.

On Windows, make sure the python.exe and python Scripts directory are on
your path. More information for `installing python on
Windows <https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html>`__ can be found
here.

Note: See the Installation Troubleshooting section below if you run into
any problems.

Python
~~~~~~

- Installation requires python and setuptools. Download `python here <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__.

- On Windows, make sure the python.exe and python Scripts directory are on your path. More information for `installing python on Windows <https://docs.python.org/2/using/windows.html>`__ can be found here.

- **Note:** See the Installation Troubleshooting section below if you run into any problems.


Docker
~~~~~~
- Follow the instructions here to get Docker installed on your host machine https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge


 **Enabling Docker on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**

   **Note:** *This section applies to Windows machines only and usually targets developer environments.*

 - To get iotedgectl to work in WSL here are additional installation steps that need to be done.

 1. Do not install Docker in WSL, instead first install Docker on your Windows machine.

  - Docker installed on the Windows machine can be used directly within the bash shell.

 2. In Docker Settings Window under *'General'*, check *"Expose Daemon on tcp://localhost:2375 without TLS"*

 3. Next steps require to the run from a bash shell

  a. Add the docker executable files to the **$PATH** environment variable and set up aliases.

   - Edit file *~/.bashrc* and add these lines:

    ::

     PATH="$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
     PATH="$PATH:/mnt/c/Program\ Files/Docker/Docker/resources/bin"
     alias docker=docker.exe
     alias docker-machine=docker-machine.exe
     alias docker-compose=docker-compose.exe
     export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://localhost:2375"

   - Save and close the *~/.bashrc* file

  b. Add environment variable **DOCKER_HOST** to sudoers.

   - Edit sudoers configuration by running

    ::

     sudo visudo

  - Add this line to the file

   ::

    Defaults env_keep += "DOCKER_HOST"

  - Save and close the file


 c. Ensure the environment variables get exported

  ::

   source ~/.bashrc

 d. Test installation by running any docker command. Examples:

  ::

   docker ps
   docker images



Install the tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a terminal, complete the following steps run
``pip install azure-iot-edge-runtime-ctl`` (may need to run as
administrator)

This should install the ``iotedgectl`` tool on your path.

See `Installation Troubleshooting <#installation-troubleshooting>`__ for
common installation problems.

How To Run:
-----------

The main commands to operate the IoT Edge runtime are: setup, start,
restart, stop, status, update, login and uninstall.

-  **setup**: This command accepts user input to configure the runtime.
   The required configuration files and certificates to operate the IoT
   Edge are created as part of this step.

   IoT Edge can be setup either by using an input configuration file and
   command line (CLI) argument --config-file or by specifying the
   various configuration values via the *setup* CLI arguments. If using the
   --config-file argument, all other CLI arguments will be ignored.

   The 'setup' command, may need to be run with admin (sudo) privileges. One
   resulting output of this command is a configuration file generated in JSON
   format. The directory where this file is generated is configurable and if
   unspecified, default paths (see below) will be used.

   There are 3 ways the Edge config directory is set, here they are in the order
   of precedence:

    1. Environment variable **EDGECONFIGDIR** - When using this, an absolute
       path to a directory on the host must be specified as the value of this
       variable.

    2. iotedgectl CLI options to specify a directory path.

     * --config-file: Configure the input JSON config file with the directory path as described in this document below.

     * --edge-config-dir: When using this option, an absolute path to a directory on the host must be specified.

     *Note*: If environment variable **EDGECONFIGDIR** and a CLI option is specified,
     the environment variable will take precedence and the CLI option will be ignored.

    3. If none of the above are set, the following default paths will be chosen:

     ::

        Default IoT Edge Configuration Host Paths:
        ------------------------------------------
            Linux:   /etc/azure-iot-edge
            Windows: %PROGRAMDATA%\azure-iot-edge\config
            MacOS:   /etc/azure-iot-edge


-  **start**: This command starts the IoT Edge runtime. This command downloads
   the Edge Agent image unless already available on the host machine.
   Configuration information specified during the **setup** step above
   is supplied to the Edge Agent when it is instantiated.

-  **stop**: This command stops the IoT Edge runtime. Note: The Edge
   modules are stopped and not removed.

-  **restart**: This command restarts the IoT Edge runtime and behaves
   like start if the Edge runtime does not exist on the host. If a runtime is
   active, it will be stopped along with any modules deployed by the
   Edge runtime. Subsequently, the Edge runtime and all other modules will be
   restarted again.

-  **status**: Prints the current state of the IoT Edge runtime.

-  **uninstall**: This command stops and uninstalls the IoT Edge
   runtime. Running uninstall will delete the configuration file,
   certificates. Additionally, the IoT Edge runtime and all modules will
   be removed.

-  **update**: This command accepts an Edge Agent image as input and
   configures the IoT Edge with this new image. Running this command
   will update the IoT Edge configuration file with this new image and
   the existing Edge Agent will be stopped, its older image removed and
   restarted with the new image.

-  **login**: This command accepts a registry server, username and
   credentials as input and configures the IoT Edge with this data.
   Running login will update the IoT Edge configuration file with the
   registry information. This is useful for users who host their module
   images on private registries. Note: in the event the Edge runtime is
   active and running, the Edge Agent will be stopped and the existing
   instance will be removed and restarted with the new credentials.

Here are a few sample command invocations:

* Print Help and Exit

 ::

    $> iotedgectl --help

* Setup the IoT Edge Runtime using an IoT Edge Host Configuration file. Please see `IoT Edge Host Configuration File Description <#edge-host-configuration-file-description>`__

 ::

    $> iotedgectl setup --help
    $> iotedgectl setup --config-file edge_config.json
    $> iotedgectl --verbose DEBUG setup --config-file edge_config.json
    Note: When specifying the homeDir path on Windows please use "C:\\example\\edge-home"

* Setup the IoT Edge Runtime using manually specified command line arguments

 ::

    $> iotedgectl setup --connection-string "HostName=<>;DeviceId=<>;SharedAccessKey=<>"
    Note: When specifying the connection string ensure that it is surrounded by double quotes ".
    In general, anything with a semicolon should be put into quotes.

* Start the IoT Edge Runtime

 ::

    $> iotedgectl start
    $> iotedgectl --verbose INFO start

* Restart the IoT Edge Runtime

 ::

    $> iotedgectl restart
    $> iotedgectl --verbose INFO restart

* Stop the IoT Edge Runtime

 ::

    $> iotedgectl stop
    $> iotedgectl --verbose INFO stop

* Uninstall the IoT Edge Runtime

 ::

    $> iotedgectl uninstall
    $> iotedgectl --verbose DEBUG uninstall

* Print the current status of the IoT Edge Runtime

 ::

    $> iotedgectl status
    $> iotedgectl --verbose INFO status


IoT Edge Home Directory Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The IoT Edge runtime needs a directory on the host machine in order to
execute. This directory will contain the necessary configuration files,
certificates and module specific files. This is called the *EDGEHOMEDIR*.
To configure the directory path of the EDGEHOMEDIR, the CLI option
'iotedgectl setup --edge-home-dir <path>' can be used.
In case it is unspecified, the default directories listed below will be used
as the EDGEHOMEDIR:

::

    Default Host Paths:
    -------------------
        Linux:   /var/lib/azure-iot-edge
        Windows: %PROGRAMDATA%\azure-iot-edge\data
        MacOS:   /var/lib/azure-iot-edge

When using the --config-file option, an absolute directory path is required to setup the Edge runtime (see below).

*Note*: If the directory does not exist, it will be created.

As the IoT Edge runtime is executed, the following file system structure
is created under *EDGEHOMEDIR*.

::

    EDGEHOMEDIR Structure:
    -----------------------
        EDGEHOMEDIR
            .
            +-- certs   -- This directory is created by the iotedgectl utility when generating
            |              either self signed certificates or Device CA based certificates.
            +-- modules -- This directory is created by the iotedgectl utility to host
                           all the Edge Module specific files.

IoT Edge Host Configuration File Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following section describes the various configuration items required
to setup the IoT Edge. \* When using the command line options to setup
the IoT Edge, this file is auto generated. \* When using the
--config-file to setup the IoT Edge device, a configuration file with
appropriate input data would have to provided.

::

      // Config file format schema; Users should not need to modify this.
      "schemaVersion": "1",

      // IoTHub Device Connection string in the format listed below.
      // A connection string is required when using the --config-file option
      // to setup the Edge runtime.
      "deviceConnectionString": "HostName=<>;DeviceId=<>;SharedAccessKey=<>",

      // Absolute path to the IoT Edge home dir.
      // An absolute directory path is required when using the --config-file option
      // to setup the Edge runtime.
      // If the specified directory does not exist, it will be created.
      // For Windows paths, use \\ as the path separator. Example: C:\\path\\file.ext
      "homeDir": "<EDGEHOMEDIR>",

      // Absolute path to the IoT Edge configuration dir. This is an optional
      // configuration item. Please review the setup command section above to see
      // how this field is used by this utility.
      // An absolute directory path is required when using the --config-file option
      // to setup the Edge runtime.
      // If the specified directory does not exist, it will be created.

      // IoT Edge device's DNS name;
      // Specifying a FQDN is only required when operating the
      // IoT Edge as a 'Gateway' for leaf device connectivity.
      // If a FQDN is unavailable, the host name (or machine name) could be used.
      // This typically occurs when the host is not domain registered such as
      // a device on a home Wifi network. This should work just fine for Edge module
      // to Edge Hub communication but may not work for leaf device connectivity.
      // This hostname value is needed specifically to name the Edge Hub server
      // and is also used to generate the Edge Hub server certificate.
      // This server certificate is used to enable TLS connections from IoT Edge
      // modules and leaf devices.

Installation Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Raspbian
^^^^^^^^

On the raspbian platform, you may need to update pip or the setup tools:

::

    sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools pip

The Python installation may require some C libraries to be built, these
libraries require development packages not installed by default:

::

    sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev
